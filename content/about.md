# 👋 Hello World

I'm a Level 99 Infrastructure Wizard specializing in the arcane arts of Cloud Native technologies. By day, I craft robust infrastructure solutions; by night, I'm probably debugging that one Kubernetes pod that refuses to play nice.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure
- **CI/CD**: GitLab, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Languages**: Go, Python, Bash (and occasionally YAML as a programming language 😉)

## 🎮 When Not Breaking Production

- 🎮 Playing Dota 2 (and still blaming supports)
- 📺 Watching anime and relating every infrastructure problem to an anime plot
- 🤔 Thinking about how to containerize literally everything
- 🔧 Contributing to open-source projects
- 📝 Writing about my adventures in tech

## 💬 Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out if you want to:

- Discuss infrastructure best practices
- Share Dota 2 strategies
- Debate whether Kubernetes is actually just a distributed systems anime
- Talk about anything cloud native!

Remember: In the world of infrastructure, we don't make mistakes — we have happy little accidents that lead to post-mortems and learning opportunities! 🎨

When I'm not wrestling with Kubernetes clusters or debugging infrastructure at 2 AM, you'll find me binging shows that either make me laugh or make me think. Here's my watchlist confession.

## The Sitcom Holy Trinity

### That 70's Show

There's something timeless about a bunch of teenagers sitting in a basement, roasting each other. The circle scenes, Red's threats about putting his foot somewhere uncomfortable, and Kelso's stupidity that somehow loops back to genius. It's comfort TV at its finest.

### Arrested Development

"I've made a huge mistake." Haven't we all? This show rewards rewatching like no other. The layered jokes, the callbacks, the narrator's deadpan delivery - it's a masterclass in comedy writing. The Bluth family dysfunction hits different when you've seen enough corporate chaos yourself.

### How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM)

Yes, I have opinions about the finale. But everything before that? Legendary. Barney's suits, Marshall and Lily's relationship goals, and Ted's endless romantic optimism somehow never got old. The slap bet alone deserves its own appreciation post.

## The Detective Obsession

I'm an avid detective movie and show enthusiast. Something about watching brilliant minds piece together impossible puzzles scratches an itch that debugging production issues just can't reach.

### Sherlock

Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is peak detective content. The mind palace sequences, the rapid-fire deductions, the chemistry with Watson - it redefined what a detective adaptation could be. "The game is on" still gives me chills.

### Detective Conan

Shinichi Kudo trapped in a kid's body, solving murders that somehow happen everywhere he goes. The Japanese detective anime that's been running since 1996 and I'm still invested. The Black Organization arc is *chef's kiss*.

### High Potential

This one's newer, but it has a lot of potential (pun intended). The premise of a high-IQ cleaning lady solving crimes that stump detectives? Count me in. It's fresh, it's fun, and it's finding its groove.

## The Common Thread

Whether it's a sitcom or a detective thriller, I gravitate toward smart writing. Shows that respect their audience, plant seeds that pay off later, and create characters you'd want to grab a beer with (or solve crimes with).

What's on your watchlist? Always looking for recommendations - especially if it involves either a laugh track or a magnifying glass.

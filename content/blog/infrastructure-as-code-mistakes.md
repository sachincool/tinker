# Infrastructure as Code: Mistakes I Made So You Don't Have To

After managing infrastructure with Terraform for years, I've made every mistake in the book. Here are the ones that hurt the most.

## 1. Hardcoding Everything

**The Mistake:** My first Terraform config looked like this:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

Seems fine until you need to deploy to another region or environment.

**The Fix:** Use variables and data sources:

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}
```

## 2. Not Using Remote State

**The Mistake:** Keeping `terraform.tfstate` locally. Lost my state file once. Never again.

**The Fix:** Always use remote state:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

Enable versioning on that S3 bucket. Trust me.

## 3. Massive Monolithic Configs

**The Mistake:** One giant `main.tf` with 2000 lines. Good luck finding anything.

**The Fix:** Break it up:
- `main.tf` - Main resources
- `variables.tf` - Input variables
- `outputs.tf` - Output values
- `versions.tf` - Provider versions
- Separate modules for reusable components

## 4. Not Locking Provider Versions

**The Mistake:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

Provider updates, breaks everything. Classic.

**The Fix:**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. Destroying Production by Accident

**The Mistake:** Running `terraform destroy` in the wrong terminal window. We've all been there.

**The Fix:** 
- Use workspace prefixes in your terminal
- Add lifecycle prevent_destroy blocks:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "critical" {
  # ...
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

- Use Terraform Cloud with proper RBAC

## Lessons Learned

Infrastructure as Code is powerful, but it's also dangerous. Treat your Terraform code like production code because it literally creates your production.

My golden rules:
1. Always use remote state
2. Lock your provider versions
3. Use modules for reusability
4. Test in dev first (obvious but ignored)
5. Plan before apply, always

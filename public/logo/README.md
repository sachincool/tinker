# Logo Files

## How to Add Your Logo

1. Save your generated logo image as `infra-magician-logo.png` in this directory
2. The logo should be a square image (1:1 aspect ratio) for best results
3. Recommended size: 512x512px or 1024x1024px

## Current Logo Location

The logo is referenced in:
- `components/blog/header.tsx` - Main site header

## To Update:

Simply replace `/public/logo/infra-magician-logo.png` with your new logo file.

The site will automatically use the new logo after refreshing the page.

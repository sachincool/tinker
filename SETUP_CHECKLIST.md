# üöÄ Setup Checklist

## ‚úÖ Already Done (Automatic)

These work out of the box with zero configuration:

- [x] Likes system with real counts
- [x] View tracking with unique visitors
- [x] File-based storage (auto-creates `data/` directory)
- [x] Privacy-friendly IP tracking
- [x] Optimistic UI updates
- [x] Error handling and loading states
- [x] Improved Konami Code hint

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Setup Required

### 1. Enable GitHub Discussions (5 minutes)

**For Comments to Work:**

1. Go to your GitHub repo: `https://github.com/sachincool/blogs`
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Features**
3. Check ‚úÖ **Discussions**
4. Create a category called "Blog Comments" (or any name)

### 2. Configure Giscus (10 minutes)

1. Install Giscus app: https://github.com/apps/giscus
2. Click **Configure** ‚Üí Select your `sachincool/blogs` repo
3. Go to https://giscus.app
4. Enter:
   - Repository: `sachincool/blogs`
   - Page ‚ÜîÔ∏è Discussions Mapping: `pathname`
   - Discussion Category: `Blog Comments`
5. **Copy the generated values:**
   - `data-repo-id`
   - `data-category-id`

6. Update `/components/blog/comments.tsx`:
```tsx
<Giscus
  repo="sachincool/blogs"  // ‚úÖ Already correct
  repoId="YOUR_REPO_ID"     // ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace this
  categoryId="YOUR_CATEGORY_ID"  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace this
  // ... rest stays the same
/>
```

### 3. Test Locally (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Test:
# 1. Click like button ‚Üí should persist on refresh
# 2. View counter ‚Üí should increment once per session
# 3. Scroll to comments ‚Üí should see Giscus widget
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel (3 minutes)

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Add robust likes, views, and comments"
git push

# Vercel auto-deploys on push
# Or manually: vercel --prod
```

**Note:** File-based storage works on Vercel but **resets on deployment**. For production persistence, see upgrade options below.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Likes/Views not working?

**Check:**
1. API routes are accessible: Visit `/api/likes?slug=test`
   - Should return: `{"count":0,"liked":false}`
2. `data/` directory is writable
3. No errors in browser console

**Quick fix:**
```bash
# Create data directory manually
mkdir -p data
touch data/likes.json data/views.json
echo '{}' > data/likes.json
echo '{}' > data/views.json
```

### Comments not showing?

**Check:**
1. GitHub Discussions is enabled ‚úÖ
2. Giscus app is installed on your repo ‚úÖ
3. `repoId` and `categoryId` are correct ‚ö†Ô∏è
4. Repository is **public** (Giscus doesn't work with private repos)

**Quick test:**
Visit https://giscus.app and follow the configuration wizard again.

### Data resets on Vercel?

**This is expected with file-based storage!**

Vercel's serverless functions are stateless, so files reset on deployment.

**Solutions:**
1. **Accept it** - Fine for dev blogs where exact counts don't matter
2. **Upgrade to Vercel KV** - 15 min setup, free tier
3. **Use Upstash** - More generous free tier
